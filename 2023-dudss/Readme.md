# Functional languages for data science (at scale)

## Durham University Data Science Society, Durham, January 2023

* [Talk slides](djw-dudss.pdf)
* Some languages and libraries: [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Dex](https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang)
* [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/) - experiment with Scala in a browser
* Materials for a recent talk on [scalable Bayesian computation](../2022-ld/Readme.md)
* Materials for my upcoming short-course on [functional programming for scalable statistical computing and machine learning](https://github.com/darrenjw/fp-ssc-course)
* Code and blog posts on [MCMC for Bayesian inference](https://github.com/darrenjw/logreg/) using several different (functional) programming languages
* Materials for my course on [Scala for statistical computing and data science](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course/blob/master/StartHere.md)
* My PhD project on [Scalable Bayesian computation](https://darrenjw.github.io/work/research/phd/)
